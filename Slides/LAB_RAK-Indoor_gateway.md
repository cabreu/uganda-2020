## Building a RAK7243 Gateway

https://doc.rakwireless.com/rak7243c-lorawan----developer-gateway/quick-start-guide

The assembly and the burning of SD cards is already done.

```
If you wanted to burn sd card yourself:

https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/

``` 

So we start here:

https://doc.rakwireless.com/rak7243c-lorawan----developer-gateway/accessing-your-gateway

You may connect either over Wi-Fi or ethernet cable.

You may then
```
ssh pi@192.168.230.1
```
(change IP address accordingly if on ethernet)

Dont worry about the line
```The authenticity of host '192.168.230.1 (192.168.230.1)' can't be established.```

- it is ok. (why?)
